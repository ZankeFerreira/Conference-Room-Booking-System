# Reflection

I assumed README files were made just for people who want to use the project’s files and code. I assumed that you only need to include installation instructions and code explanation for the user to copy and use in their personal projects. I know now that a README must also be used for onboarding new developers to the project. The README needs to include the technology stack, instructions that will help the setup of the project, so that the developer can begin contributing, and guidance on how to document the project.
Pull requests are really important because it helps with confirming that the application will run if code is committed to the main branch. It is a quick and easy way of accepting or giving feedback on the code requested to be included. Issues is also an easy way of organising bug fixing or feature request, to make sure that the application is the best version it can be. All of the issues are grouped together, with a convenient feature of giving feedback and accepting an issue.
