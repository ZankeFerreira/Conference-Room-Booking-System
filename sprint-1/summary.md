# Sprint 1 Summary 
Sprint Goal: Enable users to book and cancel room bookings and develop an admin dashboard   
Sprint Duration: 4 weeks   
Team: John Doe, Jane Doe, Zanke Ferreira, Team member 1   
Date: 2026/02/03

## Executive Summary 
This sprint focused on developing the core fucntionality of the conference booking system, with making and canceling a room booking.
These features were completed but the other tasks taken on in the sprint was not. 
This was due to the admin dashboard's scope being much larger than anticipated and the fucntion of setting recurring meetings being of lesser priority.

## Key acccomplishments
- Story #1: Basic room booking: The employees can book a conference room at their prefered date and time without creating conflicts with other bookings
- Story #4: Booking cancellation: Employees can cancel their reservations,freeing that space for others

## Challenges faced
- Story #6: Admin dashboard viewing was greatly underestimated in size and complexity, preventing it from being completed within sprint 1
- Story #2: Recurring meetings setup was defered due to inadequate planning and prioritisation, which needs to be reassessed before the next sprint

## Process improvements identified
- Ensure stories are properly estimated and have clear acceptance citeria before sprint planning begins
- Subtasks should align logically with the aceptance criteria, with their order carefully thought out to prevent any dependency issues in the future
