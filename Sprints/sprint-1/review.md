## Stakeholder Feedback
- Positive Feedback   
    * It was a good decision to defer Story #2, as it was the least important of the User stories
- Concerns or questions
    * Some dependencies did not make sense, e.g. why story #7 maintenance scheduling relied on Story #2 Booking deletion
    * A subtask is needed for each acceptance criteria
- Requests or adjustments
    * Fix the order of the subtasks to be more logical
    * Fix the brought up dependency issues
