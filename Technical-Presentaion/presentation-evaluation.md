# Presentation Self-Evaluation

---

## Clarity of Explanation

The presentation clearly explains why Git is important for this project and how collaboration is managed.

---

## Technical Accuracy

All explanations align with the actual repository structure and standard GitHub workflows.
No features or processes were described that do not exist in the project.

---

## Structure and Flow

The presentation follows the required slide structure and flows logically from context to workflow, risks, and summary.
Each slide builds on the previous one.

---

## Confidence in Delivery

The speaker notes are concise and explanatory rather than scripted.
The problem comes when presenting the presentation in person. Tone, delivery and conficence is all important and is in need of improvement. 

---

## Areas for Improvement

More focus should be put on presenting in front of an audience. Ideally, the topic should be presented in such a way in which the audience should not feel the need to clarify something. The pace of speaking should be slowed down, and words should be more articulated.

## Overall Reflection

This presentation successfully communicates the Git and collaboration workflow in a professional and onboarding-friendly manner.
