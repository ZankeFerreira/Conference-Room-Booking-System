- Admnistration interface - allows the administrator to have an overview of the current bookings and access utilisation data 
- Maintenance access - the rooms can be marked for maintenance and the appropriate adjustments will be made
- Visitor's booking - the receptionist can make booking for clients

At this stage, the system is documented through:
- Sprint planning artefacts
- API documentation

Implementation details will be added in later modules
